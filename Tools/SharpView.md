[SharpView](https://github.com/tevora-threat/SharpView) was designed to be a C# port of [[PowerView]] and therefore has much the same functionality.  However, one downside is that it doesn't have the same piping ability as PowerShell.

## Example Command

---

```
C:\Tools\SharpView\SharpView\bin\Release\SharpView.exe Get-Domain
```
